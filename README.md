# Micro-Reddit

In this project we built a Rails App allowing users to create posts and to comment on them. In order to accomplish this, models for Users, Posts, and Comments were generated and the associations between them were specified. The entity-relationship diagram below shows an overview of how the models (tables) in the app are associated with one another:
